My understanding is that we would need to reference the cog.href and then the bands from there\n\n# Make sure we know that the bands are discoverable\n\n# Pick the first item to inspect the assets\nitem = citems[0]\n\n# Inspect assets in the item\nfor asset_key, asset in item.assets.items():\n    print(f\"Asset: {asset_key}\")\n    \n    # Check if the asset has eo:bands metadata\n    if 'eo:bands' in asset.extra_fields:\n        bands = asset.extra_fields['eo:bands']\n        for band in bands:\n            print(f\"Band: {band['name']} - {band['description']} - {band['common_name']} \")\n\nAsset: cloud\nAsset: cloud_probability\nAsset: metadata\nAsset: thumbnail\nAsset: topographic_shadow\nAsset: cog\nBand: B02 - Blue - blue \nBand: B03 - Green - green \nBand: B04 - Red - red \nBand: B05 - Visible and Near Infrared - rededge \nBand: B06 - Visible and Near Infrared - rededge \nBand: B07 - Visible and Near Infrared - rededge \nBand: B08 - Visible and Near Infrared - nir \nBand: B08a - Visible and Near Infrared - nir08 \nBand: B11 - Short Wave Infrared - swir16 \nBand: B12 - Short Wave Infrared - swir22 \nAsset: valid_pixels\nAsset: saturated_pixels\n\n\nSo we know that we can see the band information held in eo:bands, and that the asset is cog which has an associated url to the tif.\nLet’s compare items with citems and see how the structure differs\n\nitems[0]\n\n\ncitems[0]\n\n\n# Sense check that I can see the information I need to \nstac_item = citems[1]\nprint(stac_item.assets['cog'].href)\nstac_item.assets['cog'].extra_fields['eo:bands'][1]['name']\n\nhttps://dap.ceda.ac.uk/neodc/sentinel_ard/data/sentinel_2/2023/11/17/S2A_20231117_latn518lonw0008_T30UXC_ORB137_20231117131218_utm30n_osgb_vmsk_sharp_rad_srefdem_stdsref.tif\n\n\n'B03'\n\n\nThere is some interesting information here: https://github.com/stac-extensions/eo?tab=readme-ov-file#spectral-bands\n\n\nWorkaround?\nBasically we just want to be able to create an xarray object from the individual bands held in the CEDA STAC catalogue.\n\nimport rioxarray\n\n# Access the URL for an individual CEDA STAC asset to test opening it using rioxarray\ndatafile = stac_item.assets['cog'].href\n\nrds = rioxarray.open_rasterio(datafile, overview_level=3)\nrds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.DataArray (band: 10, y: 695, x: 695)&gt;

    "text": "What is coherence and why is it useful?\nSAR Coherence refers to a measure of similarity between two Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired over the same area at different times.\nIt is a key parameter in SAR interferometry (InSAR) and coherence analysis, providing insights into changes or stability within the observed area.\nSAR coherence is mathematically defined as the normalized cross-correlation of the complex SAR signals from two images. The coherence depends on factors such as changes in the scene between the acquisition dates (temporal decorrelation), differences in the imaging geometry and the noise inherent to the SAR system.\n\nWhy SAR Coherence is Useful in Habitat Analysis\nSAR coherence provides valuable information for habitat monitoring and analysis. Its usefulness stems from its sensitivity to changes in the structure, moisture, and composition of vegetation, soil, and other ground surfaces. This is dependant on the imaging system collecting the data.\n\nDetecting Change and Stability:\n\nAreas with low coherence often indicate changes such as vegetation growth, deforestation, flooding, or urban development.\nIn habitats, it can help identify seasonal changes, disturbances, or degradation over time.\nHigh coherence suggests minimal change, useful for identifying stable habitats or regions of consistent land cover .\n\nMapping Vegetation Dynamics:\n\nLinked to (1): Temporal coherence variations correlate with vegetation density and structure, providing insights into biomass estimation and forest health.\n\nDifferentiating Land Covers:\n\nDifferent land cover types (e.g., forests, wetlands, grasslands) exhibit characteristic coherence signatures due to their unique scattering properties.\n\nFlood and Wetland Monitoring:\n\nCoherence can be used to monitor hydrological changes in wetlands and floodplains, as water surfaces cause a significant reduction in coherence.\n\n\nSAR coherence serves as a powerful tool in remote sensing for understanding and managing ecosystems."

    "text": "https://www.commonwl.org/v1.1/CommandLineTool.html#CommandLineTool\nA parameter is a named symbolic input or output of process, with an associated datatype or schema. During execution, values are assigned to parameters to make the input object or output object used for concrete process invocation.\nA CommandLineTool is a process characterized by the execution of a standalone, non-interactive program which is invoked on some input, produces output, and then terminates.\nA workflow is a process characterized by multiple subprocess steps, where step outputs are connected to the inputs of downstream steps to form a directed acylic graph, and independent steps may run concurrently.\nA process requirement modifies the semantics or runtime environment of a process. If an implementation cannot satisfy all requirements, or a requirement is listed which is not recognized by the implementation, it is a fatal error and the implementation must not attempt to run the process, unless overridden at user option. Requirements specified in a parent Workflow are inherited by step processes if they are valid for that step. If the substep is a CommandLineTool only the InlineJavascriptRequirement, SchemaDefRequirement, DockerRequirement, SoftwareRequirement, InitialWorkDirRequirement, EnvVarRequirement, ShellCommandRequirement, ResourceRequirement are valid. Requirements override hints.\nA hint is similar to a requirement; however, it is not an error if an implementation cannot satisfy all hints. The implementation may report a warning if a hint cannot be satisfied.\nParameter references are denoted by the syntax $(…)\nAn expression is a fragment of Javascript/ECMAScript 5.1 code evaluated by the workflow platform to affect the inputs, outputs, or behavior of a process. Expressions are distinct from regular processes in that they are intended to modify the behavior of the workflow itself rather than perform the primary work of the workflow. Expressions in CWL are an optional feature and are not required to be implemented by all consumers of CWL documents. They should be used sparingly, when there is no other way to achieve the desired outcome. Excessive use of expressions may be a signal that other refactoring of the tools or workflows would benefit the author, runtime, and users of the CWL document in question. To declare the use of expressions, the document must include the process requirement InlineJavascriptRequirement. Expressions may be used in any field permitting the pseudo-type Expression, as specified by this document.\nThe generic execution sequence of a CWL process (including workflows and command line line tools) is as follows.\n\nLoad input object.\nLoad, process and validate a CWL document, yielding one or more process objects. The $namespaces present in the CWL document are also used when validating and processing the input object.\nIf there are multiple process objects (due to $graph) and which process object to start with is not specified in the input object (via a cwl:tool entry) or by any other means (like a URL fragment) then choose the process with the id of “#main” or “main”.\nValidate the input object against the inputs schema for the process.\nValidate process requirements are met.\nPerform any further setup required by the specific process type.\nExecute the process.\nCapture results of process execution into the output object.\nValidate the output object against the outputs schema for the process.\nReport the output object to the process caller.\n\nBy convention, a CWL document may begin with #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner and be marked as executable (the POSIX “+x” permission bits) to enable it to be executed directly. A workflow platform may support this mode of operation; if so, it must provide cwl-runner as an alias for the platform’s CWL implementation.\nhttps://docs.dockstore.org/en/develop/getting-started/getting-started-with-cwl.html\nIt is recommended that you have the following minimum fields:\n``` doc:  id:  label: \ncwlVersion: v1.1\ndct:creator: foaf:name: ```"
